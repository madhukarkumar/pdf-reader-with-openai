because we wanted to help organizations of all types and sizes. There were countless industry and academic publications describing what Data Science is and why we should care, but very little information was available to explain how to make use of data as a resource. We find that situation to be just as true today as we did two years ago, when we created the first edition of the field guide.\\n\\nAt Booz Allen Hamilton, we built an industry-leading team of Data Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic challenges for countless clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of Data Science. Many people have put forth their thoughts on single aspects of Data Science. We believe we can offer a broad perspective on the conceptual models, tradecraft, processes and culture of Data Science – the what, the why, the who and the how. Companies with strong Data Science teams often focus on a single class of problems – graph algorithms for social network analysis, and recommender models for online shopping are two notable examples. Booz Allen is different. In our role as consultants, we support a diverse set of government and commercial clients across a variety of domains. This allows us to uniquely understand the DNA of Data Science.\\n\\nOur goal in creating The Field Guide to Data Science was to capture what we have learned and to share it broadly. The field of Data Science has continued to advance since we first released the field guide. As a result, we decided to release this second edition, incorporating a few new and important concepts. We also added technical depth and richness that we believe practitioners will find useful.\\n\\nWe want this effort to continue driving forward the science and art of Data Science.', 'metadata': {'source': '/tmp/tmplkl6w5jl'}}\n"]}],"source":["print(texts[0].__dict__)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"id":"71066371-5f3d-4bf5-ad4e-a99c39ab269a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T17:47:27.073324Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T17:47:27.073000Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T17:47:27.076949Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T17:47:27.076213Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T17:47:27.073303Z"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sqlalchemy import *\n","\n","db_connection = create_engine(connection_url)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"id":"75f3c756-bb62-4159-824b-afd67c5fc42a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T17:47:29.643333Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T17:47:29.642870Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T17:47:31.330187Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T17:47:31.329260Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T17:47:29.643311Z"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install tiktoken --quiet"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7c6b18f6-1c87-46a9-9b78-9fd6e1e12a10","metadata":{},"source":["### Now let's add the embeddings to the my_book table.
